# Dynamic-Fourier-Analysis
This repository includes the Dynamic Fourier Analysis on Geophysical and Fanancial Time Series. In geophysics, a sequence of intraplate
earthquake with 5.2 magnitude that occurred in Arizona in 2014 at the same location where mining explosions had been carried out some years earlier. 
Expectedly, the mining explosions and the earthquakes generated similar signals. Using the Fast Fourier Transform, we analyze the 
power spectrum to discriminate the signals between natural earthquakes and mining explosions.
In Finance, I anlyzed the Fast Fourier tarnsform to detect the Financial crahs of high frequecy stock market data.
I used the tapering process with DFT technique to avoid the spectral leakage or discontinuity in the sequence. 
Our results suggest that the Dynamic Fourier Technique is effective in discriminating the power spectrum between the minute- based 
data and the day-based data corresponding to their frequencies. This type of analysis would make people more cautious in investing 
their money in stock market.
